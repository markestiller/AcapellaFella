# AcapellaFella

## Problem Domain
Our problem domain is focused on making a trivia game. At a high level we were planning on creating a multiplayer game where one person is selected to sing a song in front of the other players and said players would have to guess what song the singer is singing. The person selected as the singer will have the option to pick one of the three randomized songs which will be retrieved from the Spotify API. 

## API Documentation
[Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api)

## Hoppscotch Example
The following examples use Hoppscotch to test the Spotify API. Since the access token test requires both parameter and header data, which can't be shown in one screenshot, the following links are provided instead.

[Requesting track data](https://hopp.sh/r/9KAk1NiLXi1Z)

## Java Example
### Input
```
String accessToken = SpotifyDemo.requestAccessToken();

JSONObject artistData = SpotifyDemo.requestArtistData(accessToken, "3ICflSq6ZgYAIrm2CTkfVP");
System.out.println(artistData.toString(4));
```

### Output
```
